FarleyFile
==========

The name here comes from a practice Eisenhower had of keeping an information file on everybody he knew so that he could review it before interacting with them. There's a lot of information out there on the web about the people we know, and the aim of this project is to help people reclaim control of the data regarding the people that they know and store it in a single place.

# Setup

You can begin either by starting to create files on your own or importing your contacts from one of the social media platforms that supports such data exports.

# Deduping & Merging

If you import from a number of social media platforms then merging duplicate contacts will be required and there is functionality to do this automagically as well as manually when there are conflicts.

# Contributing

1. Login
