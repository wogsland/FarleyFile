# Integrations

Integration credentials are stored in `.env`, which can be created by

    cp .env-example .env

and the adding your specific credentials. Details on obtaining those credentials for the various integrations can be found below.

### Github

Get your [Github access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) from the settings.

### Strava

Follow the [API getting started guide](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/) provided by Strava to get your access token. Sadly Strava has broken their API so you can no lower access pretty much anything.

### Twitter

Create a [Twitter App](https://apps.twitter.com/) and go to "Kays and tokens" for that app to obtain the four credentials needed.
